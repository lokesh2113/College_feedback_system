# College Feedback System

A Python-based feedback platform for educational institutions that digitizes the student feedback process and provides actionable insights.  
The system features role-based modules for **Admin**, **Student**, and **Faculty**, enabling feedback collection, management, and review.

A key highlight is the integrated **LLaMA 3.2-powered chatbot**, which:
- Summarizes collected feedback
- Performs sentiment analysis
- Answers queries like “Which professor is the best?” based on feedback data

This combination of structured feedback forms and AI-driven insights makes the system both efficient and intelligent, improving transparency and decision-making.
